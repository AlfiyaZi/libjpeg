This project implements a complete(!) JPEG (10918-1 ITU.T-81) codec,
plus a library that can be used to encode and decode JPEG streams.

Unlike many other implementations, libjpeg also implements:

- 12 bpp image coding for the lossy DCT process,
- the predictive lossless mode of 10918-1,
- the hierarchical process of 10918-1,
- the arithmetic coding option of 10918-1,
- coding of up to 256 component images
- upsampling of images for all factors from 1x1 to 4x4

Standard features are of course also supported, such as
sequential and progressive mode in 8bpp.


In addition, this codec provides methods to encode images *without loss*
using the DCT process in a backwards compatible way. That is, this codec
can create images such that

- all existing JPEG implementations can decode them, and in addition,
- this implementation can decode them without loss.

The new feature in release 0.3 is the optional lossy coding of the base layer
which is controlled by the -Q parameter. The code also includes an
optional tone mapping curve which can either be specified by the gamma parameter,
or can be determined by an automatic process implementing a version of the
exrpptm tone mapper.

*) To compress a HDR image with this version of jpeg:

Use the command line options -q quality -r

*) To specify a separate quality for the extensions layer:

Use the command line options -Q extensionslayerquality -q quality -r

*) To specify an optional tone mapping function to map the HDR input
to a more useful LDR base layer

Use the command line option -g gamma_value

where the gamma value is the nonlinearity of the LDR signal,
assuming a linear HDR signal.

*) To use an automatic tone mapping algorithm, set the -g parameter
to zero.

The following options exist for lossless coding:

*) predictive 10918-1 coding. Note, however, that not many implementations
are capable of decoding such stream, thus this is probably not a good option
for all-day purposes.

Use the command line options -p -c


*) Residual coding. This embedds a residual error image into the JPEG stream
that allows this specific codec to reconstruct images without loss. This
option provides the best coding performance for lossless coding that is still
backwards compatible to 10918.

Use the command line options -h -q 75 -Q 100 -r 

[Note that this changed in release 0.3]

*) Lossless DCT process coding. This provides progressive/embedded coding from
lossy to lossless. Its preformance isn't quite as good as that of the residual
coding, though it creates an embedded bitstream.

Use the command line options -l -q 100 -c

*) Lossless coding with JPEG LS (NOT A 10918 PROCESS, THIS IS A SEPARATE STANDARD)

Use the command line option -ls

Optinally, you may specify the JPEG LS "near" parameter (maximum error) with
the -m command line switch.

*) Lossless coding with an additional color transformation following JPEG LS
part-2 (NOT 10918, NOT JPEG LS PART 1):

Use the command line option -ls -cls
